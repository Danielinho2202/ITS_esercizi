'''Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
 The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
 It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the 
 required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
 Your function should work for a call like this one: car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
 Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. '''

    describe_car.update(car_info)
    return describe_car
